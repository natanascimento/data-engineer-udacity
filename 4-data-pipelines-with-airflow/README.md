# Event Logs Data Pipeline

## Introduction

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Pipeline

The pipeline was developed using Apache Airflow, in order to carry out the execution of the steps of the ETL process with an additional one for the creation of tables in Amazon Redshift.

### DAG

Below is the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for the ETL process of the event logs.

### Data Quality Operator
The final operator to create is the data quality operator, which is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result needs to be checked and if there is no match, the operator should raise an exception and the task should retry and fail eventually.
